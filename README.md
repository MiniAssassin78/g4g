### 5 Step Setup.
  1. Get NodeJS, version 8.1.2 or newer.
  2. Git clone or download this repository and then change to the directory in your console/terminal.
  3. Type `npm i` in your console/terminal and wait for dependencies to download and install successfully.
  4. Open up `settings.js` with any text program:
```js
module.exports = {
  timer: 61000, // Is in milliseconds. Default: 61000 ms = 1 minute & 1 second.
  twitch: {
    clientID: '' // Make a Twitch application at https://glass.twitch.tv/console/apps
  },
  discord: {
    token: '', // https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me/
    permissionForCommands: 'MANAGE_ROLES' // https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/topics/permissions

  5. Change the fields accordingly. *(Fields `twitch.clientID` & `discord.token` must have a value, otherwise program will error.)*
